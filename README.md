nook2013
========

The nook2013(Night Of Open Knowledge) is an interesting event to happen in Lübeck, Germany at 2013-11-08.
A german version of the cfp can be found under https://wiki.metameute.de/nook2013-cfp.
I hope to be holding a talk ~30min long about Raphaël (http://raphaeljs.com/), a JavaScript Vector Library.
This repo will contain the slides to that talk once they're finished.
Until then, it works as some kind of preview what the talk might be like.
